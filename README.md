# Rebounding_from_disturbance_data_analysis

DataForAnalysis.csv contains the data to run the included code. The headings in this file are:
"Plot": Plot Identifier, composed of row number (R#) and group/column number (G#)
"PlantID": Plant Identifier, composed of row number (R#), group/column number (G#), and plant number (P#)
"Row": row number, referring to spatial arrangement in field site
"Group": group number, referring to spatial arrangement in field site (think of this as the column to row)
"Plant": plant number within each plot
"Species": CA (C. acanthoides) or CN (C. nutans)
"OTC.On": Whether each plot was warmed with an open top chamber or not. 0 = ambient; 1 = warmed
"Treatment": Name of physical disturbance treatment
"MayDia": diameter (cm) of each rosette in May 2022, before application of physical disturbance treatments
"MayLLL": longest leaf length (cm) of each rosette in May 2022, before application of physical disturbance treatments
"MayStems": number of stems/growing points apparent on each plant before physical disturbance treatments in May 2022
"MayHt": height of each plant before physical disturbance treatments in May 2022
"FinalStemsRosettes": Number of growing points (stems + rosettes) at the final data collection in August 2022.
"FinalStems": Number of stems at the final data collection in August 2022
"MaxFlowers": Maximum number of anthesed capitula present on the plant at any time during the experiment
"MaxFlowersBuds": Maximum number of anthesed and unanthesed capitula present on the plant at any time during the experiment
"MaxHt": Maximum height (mm) of each plant at any time during the experiment
